BarcodeReader
=============

A simple Barcodereader for Code128, Code93, Code39 and EAN-13 barcodes in javascript.
Supports multiple barcodes in one image and detects what type of barcodes there are.

I'm currently working on comments for the code, just in case someone actually tries to understand
my scribbles.
